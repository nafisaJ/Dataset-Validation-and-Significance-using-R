# Dataset-Validation-and-Significance-using-R

The project is divided in 2 phases:

Part 1: The aim of this phase is to validate the data based on the given valid ranges of sensors through which the data 
and the acceptable range of the data. We then plot the raw and clean data.

Part 2: The aim of this phase is to check if the data is signiicant ie. the stress applied on the driver did indeed create stress.

See the readme files in the individual folders for executing the code.
